# Development Process

The process used to develop Open MCT is described in the following
documents:

* The [Development Cycle](cycle.md) describes how and when specific
  process points are repeated during development.
* The [Version Guide](version.md) describes version numbering for
  Open MCT (both semantics and process.)
* The [Test Plan](testing/plan.md) summarizes the approaches used
  to test Open MCT.
